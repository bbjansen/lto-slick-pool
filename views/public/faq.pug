						p.has-text-left Leasing is a trustless process in where the leaser delegates LTO tokens towards a block producer by creating a lease transaction. The lease can be canceled at anytime by the leaser and the LTO tokens become available instantly again for use. By leasing your LTO tokens towards a block producer, eg: LTO Services, you essentially earn interest on it like putting monies in a bank. However, the interest that is earned involves luck and thus will vary. See it as a lottery, where your LTO are lottery tickets; the more tickets, the higher the odds of winning are.

						p.has-text-left Every block that is generated by LTO Services is recorded and can be viewed <a href='/blocks' class='highlight'>here</a>. Once the 90 minute verification window has passed(as defined by the network specifications), the block will be marked as verified to ensure it is not an orphan block. The block reward is calculated based on the following formula that is taken from the LTO core concensus:
						code.has-text-centered blockReward = (currentBlockFee * 0.4) + (prevBlockFee * 0.6)
						br
						br
						p.has-text-left The process of calculating the earned reward for each lease per block involves taking all leases whom have been active before the block in question and calculating their earned share based on the following formula, which is rounded down:
						code.has-text-centered leaseShare = leaseAmount / sum(leaseAmount)
						br
						br
						p.has-text-left This ratio is multiplied by the block reward and a #{fee}% service fee is taken from this amount, rounding down. This leaves us with the earned share per lease of the block in question, which can be viewed <a href='/payments' class='highlight'>here</a>.
						code.has-text-centered leaseReward = (leaseShare * blockReward) - ((leaseShare * blockReward) * (#{fee} / 100))

						p.has-text-left Payouts are handled automatically by LTO Services every 24 hours and will only be executed if the sum of all unpaid block rewards is equal or greater than the set minimum payout limit of <b>#{payout}</b> LTO. Once this limit has been reached, payouts will be broadcasted to the LTO Network in form of a mass transaction and can be expected to be received nearly instantly to your lease address. The fee for the mass transaction is currently covered by LTO Services and is calculated using the following formula:
						code.has-text-centered massTxFee = 0.25 + (0.10 * n of transactions)
						br
						br
						p.has-text-left Please note that he minimum payout limit may be altered in order to reflect the current LTO network node environment in order to achieve minimum fees on mass transactions. The current unpaid pool sum is located in the top-right corner of the website, highlighted in orange.
